# Introduction to Version Control for Modelling & Simulation

Welcome! This session is a hands-on introduction to the fundamental principles of version control, a critical skill in modern Modelling & Simulation (M&S) development and collaborative projects.

**Class:** [Your Class Name/Number, e.g., M&S Fundamentals]
**Date:** May [], 2025
**Duration:** 50 minutes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

1.  Understand the basic concepts of version control: repository, commit, branch, and pull request.
2.  Recognize why version control is essential for tracking changes and collaboration in M&S projects.
3.  Perform basic version control operations using the GitHub web interface:
    * Forking a repository.
    * Creating and committing changes to a file.
    * Creating a new branch.
    * Opening a Pull Request to propose changes.

## Scenario

We will simulate a collaborative effort to refine observations or propose modifications for a 3D model. Our base model for this exercise is the **[Name of your 3D Model, e.g., Stanford Bunny]** (`[your_stl_file_name.stl]`).

While the model itself is a 3D object (which you can view directly in GitHub!), our "changes" today will primarily involve creating and editing text files that describe our ideas or observations related to this model.

## Tools Used

* **GitHub Web Interface:** All activities will be performed directly in your web browser using your GitHub account.
* https://www.viewstl.com/ for editing the STL files.

## Activity Overview (Instructor-Led)

Your instructor will guide you through the following general steps:

1.  **Understanding the Core:** Brief on version control.
2.  **Getting Your Copy:** Forking this main repository to your GitHub account.
3.  **Your First Contribution:** Creating a text file with observations and committing it.
4.  **Working on an Idea:** Creating a new branch for isolated changes.
5.  **Proposing Your Changes:** Opening a Pull Request to suggest your contributions to the main project.
6.  **Discussion & Integration:** Reviewing Pull Requests (simulated).

Let's get started! Your instructor will now walk you through the first steps.
